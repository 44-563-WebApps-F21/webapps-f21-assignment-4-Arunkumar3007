    <h3>The Importance of Being Earnest</h3>

    <h4>Act 2 - The Garden at the Manor House, Woolton.</h4>

    <h6 class="name CECILY">CECILY</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and
        couldn’t possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible
        for nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.</p>

    <h6 class="name PRISM">MISS PRISM</h6>
    <p class="speech">Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one
        myself in earlier days.</p>

    <h6 class="name CECILY"> CECILY</h6>
    <p class="speech">Did you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it
        did not end happily? I don’t like novels that end happily. They depress
        me so much.</p>

    <h6 class="name PRISM"> MISS PRISM</h6>
    <p class="speech">The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction
        means.</p>

    <h6 class="name CECILY">CECILY</h6>
    <p class="speech">I suppose so. But it seems very unfair. And was your novel ever
        published?</p>

    <h6 class="name PRISM"> MISS PRISM</h6>
    <p class="speech">Alas! no. The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned. [Cecily starts.]
        I use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid. To your work, child,
        these speculations are profitless.</p>

    <h6 class="name CECILY"> CECILY</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">[Smiling.]</p>
    <p class="speech">But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.</p>

    <h6 class="name PRISM">MISS PRISM</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">[Rising and advancing.]</p>
    <p class="speech">Dr. Chasuble! This is indeed a pleasure.</p>

    <p class="speech">[Enter Canon Chasuble.]</p>

    <h6 class="name CHASUBLE">CHASUBLE</h6>
    <p class="speech">And how are we this morning? Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well?</p>

    <h6 class="name CECILY">CECILY</h6>
    <p class="speech">Miss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache. I think it
        would do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the Park,
        Dr. Chasuble.</p>

    <h6 class="name PRISM">MISS PRISM</h6>
    <p class="speech">Cecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.</p>

    <h6 class="name CECILY">CECILY</h6>
    <p class="speech">No, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively that you had
        a headache. Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about my German
        lesson, when the Rector came in.</p>

    <h6 class="name CHASUBLE">CHASUBLE</h6>
    <p class="speech">I hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.</p>

    <h6 class="name CECILY">CECILY</h6>
    <p class="speech">Oh, I am afraid I am.</p>

    <h6 class="name CHASUBLE"> CHASUBLE</h6>
    <p class="speech">That is strange. Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism’s pupil, I
        would hang upon her lips. [Miss Prism glares.] I spoke
        metaphorically.—My metaphor was drawn from bees. Ahem! Mr. Worthing, I
        suppose, has not returned from town yet?</p>

    <h6 class="name PRISM">MISS PRISM</h6>
    <p class="speech"> We do not expect him till Monday afternoon.</p>

    <h6 class="name CHASUBLE">CHASUBLE</h6>
    <p class="speech">Ah yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London. He is not one
        of those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that
        unfortunate young man his brother seems to be. But I must not disturb
        Egeria and her pupil any longer.</p>

    <h6 class="name PRISM">MISS PRISM</h6>
    <p class="speech">Egeria? My name is Lætitia, Doctor.</p>

    <h6 class="name CHASUBLE">CHASUBLE</h6>
    <p class="speech">[Bowing.] A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan authors. I
        shall see you both no doubt at Evensong?</p>
